                <p class="paragraph_style_1">Calcaneal Tendon Laceration<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">His face was contorted in pain as he roared—a gut-wrenching sound—and crumpled to the ice. With courage and fortitude he rose and attempted to push off with his left leg, but the exertion only brought another cry to his lips as he pulled his dangling foot up off the ice; the pain in his leg was obviously excruciating. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">Erik Sven Gunnar Karlsson, star hockey player and captain of the Ottawa Senators, Norris Memorial Trophy winner, had suffered a lacerated achilles tendon. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">Erik Karlsson was born in Landsbro, Sweden on May 31, 1990. He was a first-round pick for the Ottawa Senators in 2008 and has since been one of the greatest defensemen the in the NHL’s history. He’s broken many, many franchise records, setting a precedent for skill and leadership on his team and for all hockey players.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">The achilles, or calcaneal, tendon is a vitally important and amazing anatomical structure. Located on the posterior of the lower leg and heel, “The Achilles tendon is the largest and strongest tendon in the human body. It is formed by the tendons of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. It is approximately 15 cm long in the adult and can handle the stress of up to 10 times body weight; typically it handles the stress of 5-7 times body weight,” according to Eugene Hong, MD, Team Physician for Drexel, Philadelphia University. This tendon is constantly stressed. Every time a person stands, sits down, jumps, runs, squats, or picks something up, immense strain is placed on those tough fibers. It’s not uncommon among athletes to suffer an achilles rupture from excessive and repetitive forces, requiring the same treatment that Erik Karlsson came to receive, though his injury was caused by a slicing mechanism. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">His devastating injury occurred on February 13, 2013 during a match with the Pittsburgh Penguins. It was a strange and unfortunate incident for many different reasons: the puck had hit the net just seconds before Karlsson suffered the injury, which should have stopped play and prevented the injury, and the man who’s skate cut Karlsson’s tendon was a Matt Cooke, renowned for his questionable sportsmanship and dirty plays. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">Karlsson was going after a rebound, chasing the puck up to the boards, when Cooke hit him from the behind, pinning him against the glass. The hit wasn’t illegal by any means, nor was the play by Cooke extraordinary, but as he jarred Karlsson from behind, Cooke lifted his left foot and his blade dug into the back of Karlsson’s left leg just above his protective skate and below his shin-guard—a small, unprotected area.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">It was unbelievably painful. Images of Karlsson’s face at the instant of the the injury portray him roaring in anguish. Immediately, he fell to the ice. Karlsson told a nearby ref that he had been cut—which stopped the game—and stood up. In an attempt to propel himself across the ice, Karlsson pushed off with his left foot, which forced another cry from his throat, and he was immediately grabbed and half-carried across the rink and into the medical exam room by teammates and coaches.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">Upon examination, it was determined that Karlsson’s left achilles tendon had been lacerated by Cooke’s ice-skate blade. The injury was deep but clean, and Karlsson was rushed to the hospital where, that night, he underwent reparative surgery. According to Bryan Murray, the Senator’s general manager, “[The injury was] a 70-percent cut of the Achilles tendon. Time frame is three to four months. The surgery, from all of our information, went well.” (Corey Masisak, <a title="http://nhl.com" href="http://nhl.com" class="style_1">NHL.com</a>)<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">The surgery in question was performed by Dr. Don Chow, team doctor for the Ottawa Senators. According to Sandeep Kulkarnia, a Kanata Orthopedic Physiotherapy Clinic physiotherapist who’s specialty is helping athletes recover from Achilles surgery, “Surgery is usually required, whether [the cut] is 50 per cent, 80 per cent or 100 per cent. You just can’t get proper strength [without surgery]. If it’s a clean laceration, it’s easier to put back together” (Ken Warren, Ottawa Citizen). Thankfully, in Karlsson’s case, the cut <span class="style_2">was</span> clean, contributing to the ease and success with which the surgeons repaired his Achilles. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">The achilles surgery, also, is a simple procedure, or as simple a procedure as a surgery can be, which, in turn, means a smaller possibility of complication: “The most common method is an open repair. This starts with an incision made on the back of the lower leg starting just above the heel bone. After the surgeon finds the two ends of the ruptured tendon, these ends are sewn together with sutures. The incision is then closed” (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society). <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">After the surgery, Karlsson was prescribed a cast and a pair of special crutches. The cast started just below his knee and went all the way to his toes, preventing Karlsson from dorsiflexing and plantarflexing his foot, both of which movements place strain on the achilles tendon. Karlsson was inquired about the cast at a press conference, and his response was as follows: “I can remove it. I slept without it the first night tonight. It’s fine. It’s just that I can’t put any weight on it and I can’t do anything with the foot; it’s just hanging there.” He continued, remarking about the purpose of the cast and his mobility, saying, “When I have the cast on, it’s in a position so [that] I can’t move my tendons there… I can walk around on it. It takes me a while to get anywhere, but that’s ok.” Karlsson had hobbled into the conference on his own strength, heavily using a set of abnormal crutches. These crutches were, in fact, the kind usually prescribed to individuals with cerebral palsy; they had bracers for Karlsson’s upper arms and handles that supported his weight rather than a padded crossbar for his armpit, allowing for greater levels of mobility, comfort, and autonomy (<a title="http://nhl.com" href="http://nhl.com" class="style_1">NHL.com</a>). <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">Needless to say, Karlsson sat out for the rest of the professional hockey season, resting and rehabilitating. The rehabilitation was as simple as the surgery he underwent; Karlsson rested, using his leg and ankle as little as he possibly could, for several weeks. According to their discretion, his doctors approved active therapy, which consisted first of standing and walking. The most crucial exercise he performed—vitally important for restoring tensile strength in the achilles—was performed on a box; he stood with his heels hanging off the box, the achilles stretched to full length. Then, as instructed, he would plantarflex until he could go no further, causing the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles to contract concentrically, and then <span class="style_2">slowly</span> dorsiflex, eccentrically contracting those same muscles and putting the most strain on the achilles, and return to his original position. Upon further physician approval, Karlsson would return to the ice, skating slowly, skating quickly, changing directions, jumping, and returning, over time, to full speed and strength. This process took several months, and Karlsson did not want to rush rehabilitation for fear of re-injury or loss of the ability to play at the high level at which he competed (Ken Warren, Ottawa Citizen).<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">Erik Karlsson returned to play in the 2013-2014 hockey season, roughly ten months after the injury occurred. His return was made with full strength and complete physical acuity, and he went on to play another phenomenal year of hockey. Furthermore, he dispelled all doubt pertaining to chronic or lasting symptoms of his injury by rising to the top of NHL’s defensemen, winning the Norris Memorial Trophy for the second time during the 2014-2015 season. Erik Karlsson’s injury, though terrible, did not stay with him, physically or mentally. He overcame, and by so doing became a model of courage and conquering adversity for his team, for his sport, and for all people who know his story. <br /></p>
