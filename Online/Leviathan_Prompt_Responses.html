                <p class="paragraph_style_5">Hobbes’s demarcation of rebellion as without reason begins and ends with the fact that successful rebellion teaches others to rebel, and no constitution or covenant can be established within a system that is constantly usurping itself. Rebellion breeds rebellion, that is to say, the throwing off of covenants breeds the throwing off of covenants, and thus there is no justice produced by rebellion. For the horrible “state of nature,” of “solitary, nasty, brutish and short” lives, is simply the lack of a covenant, that is to say, the lack of a coercive power with the efficacy to produce covenantal fidelity in its subjects; since rebellion is the throwing off of such a power, its natural end is a return to the abject and dismal state men arose from.<br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_6">The first two paragraphs of Hobbes’s eighteenth chapter are indeed single sentences; like ideas are broken not with periods but with a multitude of commas and semicolons which together convey a sense of continuity. The third paragraph, however, is very long and, if only by necessity, is speckled with periods; though upon further analysis it seems that necessity was not the only motive for the use of periods. The first and second paragraphs contain within themselves homologous sentiments and unified ideas, whereas the third presents contrasting arguments and rebuttals thereof; Hobbes, then, saw it advantageous to separate clashing sentiments with more solid punctuation. This rationalization is evidenced by the words that begin the sentences that come after those that end in periods—“Besides,” “And whereas,” “But,”—most all of which denote counterargument, which in turn implies conflicting ideas.<br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_12">In regards to the American colonies’ revolution against Britain and Britain’s crown, Hobbes’s beliefs must be weighed against historical circumstance and action; was he heeded? Firstly, the covenant formed by the Continental congress was unjust, Hobbes’s arguments claim, in the light of the colonies’ previous covenant with Britain. Secondly, the American Revolution was started because of an infringement upon the self-proclaimed rights of a minority—the colonists—under British law, and thus was an unjust revolution from the beginning. Even the colonies’ general disdain for the British crown and its leadership are unjust by Hobbes’s assessment, as a monarch, being held in covenant with the people, is supposedly above the reproach of the people. In fact, not a single one of Hobbes’s arguments expounded in this chapter of <span class="style">Leviathan</span> supports the colonial aggression towards Britain’s sovereignty.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_5"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_4">3<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_4"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_6">Hobbes’s principles of majoritarian democracy are fundamental to the American federal system. In short, Hobbes supposes that each voter submits, upon entering into a voting body, to the majority opinion thereof, whether or not he individually agrees with said opinion. If a dissenter does not forthwith abide under the covenants, that is, laws, set forth by the majority, then he may justly be destroyed, or imprisoned, as it may be. This is very much how the American political system works today. Of course, the obligation to abide by a covenant is extended not only to those who voted but to all who abide under American sovereignty, whether on American soil or by American citizenship, but the weight of Hobbes’s sentiment is exactly how the legislature of America operates. Laws are passed by majority vote, and the dissenting minority are indeed obliged to abide by those laws whether they feel they should or not. Do most Americans agree that in voting, or in simply being an American, they have “tacitly covenanted, to stand to what the major part should ordain?” I would say, in my humble opinion and experience, that most Americans live in unconscious agreement with the statement, abiding, for the most part, by the laws ordained by the majority, but I also hold that Americans would be appalled to think that in voting they covenant themselves with the rest of the body. No, Americans are a self-serving people; covenants are only held in the interest to oneself, and if a majority opinion differs to wildly from personal belief, an American will not feel justly condemned by spurning any such tacitly committed covenant. I myself, however, agree that by voting I cast my lot in with the majority whether I myself am part of that majority or not. However, I do not hold elected sovereignty to be the supreme force in this universe or even this world, and certainly not in my own life, and I do firmly believe that, by way of faith in Jesus Christ, I have entered into a higher and truer covenant with God which supersedes all other man-made covenantal relationships. If my actions are deemed unjust by a human commonwealth, so be it; God will judge.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_6"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2">~ Excerpt C ~<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_4">1<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_4"><span style="line-height: 27px; " class="style_2"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_6"><span style="line-height: 27px; " class="style_2"></span>Hobbes’s refutation of the Greek and Latin democratic proponents’ argument for lawful rebellion against monarchies--the killing of a tyrant (tyrannicide) is lawful, though the killing of a king (regicide) is not-- is poor, to say the least. His refutation is as such: the same men who write about revolution also say that the subjects of a “popular Commonwealth,” that is, a democracy, are free, whereas those that abide under a monarchic Commonwealth “are all slaves.” But, he argues, only men who abide under a monarchy conceive this opinion, and since it is not universally conceived, by those that live under a democracy also, then the idea of democratic freedom and monarchic slavery must be a fallacy. This argument lacks legitimacy in in one dire way; truth, or valid opinion, is not validated by consensus or universality. Imagine: there are twenty men, fifteen of whom are blind. One of them who can see shouts out “The grass is green.” Immediately, the other four men who have their sight agree with him, but all the blind, who are the majority, band together and harrumph, stating, “Nay, the grass is black, as is all creation.” The consensus, based upon majority, is that the grass is black; yet, the grass is green and does not lessen in its greenness because the majority of men believe it to be black. Hobbes’s argument—that an idea ceases to be valid because all men do not share it—is, then, inherently false, and thus his refutation here is ineffective.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_6"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_4">2<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_4"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_6">Hobbes’s extended analogy at the end of this excerpt compares “democratical” writers to mad dogs, biting at the monarchic commonwealths; as mad-dog bites produce in the victim hydrophobia, a state in which the infected person is parched with thirst and yet refuses all water, so also those who succumb to the writings of democratic zealots and topple their monarchies are at once in desperate need of strong, centralized government, such as only a monarch can best provide, and yet refuse any such government out of a mortal fear of tyranny. This analogy is brilliantly made, and it contributes an air of simple reason to the expansive argument Hobbes is making. By speaking his logic in terms of dogs and their bitten victims, Hobbes negotiates on a plane of easy understanding, and this simplicity, blunt and clear, creates a more forceful impact on the reader’s mind. Also, this derogatory depiction of the democratic writers as “mad dogs” lowers their intellectual standing substantially, from heralded philosophers to rabid beast, and so undermines the legitimacy of their teachings.<br /></p>
