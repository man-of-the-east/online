                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_1">Government and politics have an established historical significance to all civilizations and groups of people. When two men abide together, a fight for dominance always ensues; indeed, this power-struggle seems to be a part of the very nature of the human race. Additionally, history has proven time and time again that people are sheep, in dire straits if left without a shepherd to guide them. Often, then, men and women follow blindly, seeking refuge in the shadow of whoever’s wings prove biggest and most convenient. Due to the fact that the biggest wings aren’t always best and the convenient shepherd isn’t always just, people, for millennia, have proposed and implemented vastly different political systems with the hopes of finding the perfect fit. Two such systems are Thomas Hobbes’s elected monarchy and Niccolò Machiavelli’s conquered princedom, both of which paint power in vastly different lights and propose divergent policies in the acquisition and retainment of that power. Hobbes introduced, in his book Leviathan, a form of government where democratically-elected monarchs rule for life over commonwealths, while Machiavelli presented, in his The Prince, a philosophy of ambitious subterfuge where the most powerful and capable ruler inevitably defeats, by politics or war, his enemies and thereby seizes their principalities.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">    Thomas Hobbes’s proposed commonwealth system outstrips Machiavelli’s philosophies on nearly all fronts; the monarchic commonwealth proposed by Thomas Hobbes in his Leviathan promises utmost security, peace, stability, and unity, whereas the  the reasonable consequences of an application of Machiavelli’s principles are chaos and wanton destruction.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">    Hobbes’s philosophic fundament of government is power: as he says in Leviathan, “before the names of just and unjust can have place, there must be some coercive power to compel men.” His essence of law is a system of covenants between that coercive power and those upon whom said power is exerted—power being defined as the ability to alter another’s actions or existence in some way. According to the fifteenth chapter of Leviathan, “So that the nature of justice consisteth in keeping of valid covenants,” justice’s essence is based on those covenants; without them there is no justice and likewise no injustice. Therefore, the Commonwealth is constituted by power and covenant, and all that is good and just flows from that power and consequent covenant. Without a binding contract with a great and terrible force, men will do what they please and society would deteriorate into a perpetual state of chaos and pain. It is out of this understanding of men and power and this underlying assumption of the necessity of a covenant that Hobbes forms his Commonwealth.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">    Machiavelli instead deigns that whosoever has the guts and capacity to seize leadership has the right to do so, and he implies that power does not necessitate covenants between the powerful and the powerless. Where Hobbes’s justice takes the form of promises and commitment, Machiavelli’s derives from the whims of the ruler and the ruler’s agenda.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">    The differences between Machiavelli's Princedom and Hobbes’s commonwealth are best expressed in terms of romantic relationship. Machiavelli's principality is a free, open sexuality where the most attractive and aggressive person wins the affection and loyalty of a lover, but only until the lover becomes disinterested or a new, better sexual partner can be found. It's a cycle of broken loyalties, broken hearts, and broken bodies that never reaches a stable conclusion or provides for the well-being of either lover. Carnal appetite is the only aspect that’s whetted, and even it is never sated.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">    Hobbes, rather, proposes a system of marriage—a lifelong covenant between the Monarch and the people. Loyalty and fealty are supreme and tender. Time acquaints the monarch to the needs of the people and the people to the desires of the Monarch. This covenant of trust and steadfastness allows the monarch to stay off foreign influence—his people are his own—and keeps the people from throwing off their ruler—he is their own. The covenant of marriage provides for all that is necessary and proper for both parties to thrive. It is this unity of heart and soul, not of bodies only, that makes the commonwealth a beacon of hope for the future.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">    Unity is indeed the most valuable aspect of a Hobbesian commonwealth. On the constitution of his commonwealth Hobbes states “A Commonwealth is said to be instituted when a multitude of men do agree… to whatsoever man… [being] their representative,” and “In order to reach such a consensus, a degree of common belief and purpose must preside in the hearts and minds of the people.” Commonwealths are conceived and grow based upon their degree of unity, which in turn sets a necessary precedent for that commonwealth’s future safety and peace; a joint mind means no dissension from within, and a shield without divisive cracks is the best defensive front against a military attack from without. Since providing for the safety of the citizenry is the universal and fundamental obligation of government, Hobbes’s Commonwealth of people with united purpose is beautifully effective. His three-cord strand is not easily broken, and, without fear of being broken, that cord has the ability to thrive.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">    Machiavelli’s Princedom, however, is founded on strife and quarreling. Machiavelli proposes that the primary means of attaining power over any group of people is manipulation, where each and every politically-minded man is constantly thwarting and undermining the plans of anyone who gets in the way of their own ambition. Additionally, Machiavelli encourages any and every man to seek this power for himself, laying out a general framework of vindictive practices for his disciples. The consequences of a body of people following Machiavelli’s principles—constantly warring against one another’s pride and power—are a fractured state and a populace that’s vulnerable internally and externally; this fact is exemplified by the fractured and constantly warring feudal principalities of medieval Europe. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">    Each king, in single-minded attempts to expand their influence, fought bloody political and military wars, destroying one another indiscriminately; many members of each king’s court did the same, subverting his decrees and whittling his power down to nothing. No truce was definite, no friend was trustworthy, and the result was a complete halt of technological, social, medical, and scientific progress for more than one-thousand years. Hear it again: these bickering states, embodying all of Machiavelli’s principles, stifled civilizational advancement for an entire millennia. Literature and architecture from these dark ages portray society laid destitute to famine, to corruption, and to disease. There was no justice or safety in the law; indeed the laws did not bind unless the king wished it so, and the kings whims are as any man’s: fitful gusts of wind. Truly, medieval Europe is Machiavelli’s princedom in its finest. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">    Further contributing to these themes of civil instability, Machiavelli states, in regards to the actions of a prince, “but since [men] are dishonest and do not keep faith with you, you, in return, need not keep faith with them.” If a prince abides by this statute, so will the people, and if no person trusts any other, how can that society be called good? Indeed, a breakdown of civility is the logical conclusion of Machiavelli’s principles.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">    Stability, rather, flows forth from Hobbes’s Commonwealth. Hobbes’s elected monarch has no political rivals to speak of—he rules undisputed and for life. Also, the monarch, ordained by a binding covenant and having the coercive power necessary to keep his people within the bounds of that covenant, is then free to focus nearly all his energies on service unto his people. Instead of scheming the downfall of a political adversary, as The Prince exhorts, Hobbes’s monarchic position has the ability to adequately see to the well-being, the health, the safety, and the prosperity of the Commonwealth. The monarchy is an extremely stable position; the princedom is the very image of unsteadiness. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">    The one potential fallacy in Hobbes’s proposed monarchic commonwealth is the legal impunity of the sovereign. Hobbes says of that impunity, “because every subject is by this institution author of all the actions and judgements the sovereign instituted, it follows that whatsoever he [does], can be no injury to any of his subjects; nor ought he to be by any of them accused of injustice.” Hobbes is saying here that the public, having voted on a leader, condones all of his ensuing decisions and has no right to decry any of his actions as unjust or harmful. The vote is the covenant between the subject and the monarch—a writ of approval, as it may be—that the monarch has the authority to do practically whatsoever he wishes. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">    Since power is known to corrupt, and supreme power would then corrupt to a supreme degree, it can be logically deduced that holding sovereign power over a lifetime would definitely tarnish a man’s heart and twist his motives to perverse and self-serving ends. The fact that corruption happens to those in power is universal, but the degree to which that corruption affects their office is often directly related to the accountability and checks placed on that government official. Hobbes proposes no such check or balance, risking both the monarch and the populace to the blemished winds of a man’s character. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">    However, since the monarch’s governing power is legitimized by covenants with the people, moral statutes can be part of those covenants, forcing the monarch to stay within certain bounds and away from tyranny. If the monarch strains and breaks those bounds, it would no longer be unjust for the people to rise against him, for the covenant has been shattered and justice is gone. Indeed, by instituting moral provisions in the binding covenant, it would come to be in the monarch’s best interest to stay within his peoples’ guidelines; otherwise, he would exist in perpetual fear of outcry and public denunciation, both of which would lead to an impotent monarchic position. Thus, an institution of moral standards within the commonwealth’s founding documents would protect the people from tyranny.<br /></p>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_1">    The potential consequences of Hobbes’s monarchic impunity do not undermine the entirety of his commonwealth. Machiavelli’s entire system, however, is built on shifting sands of shifty character, bound to fall with little provocation. Know that a Hobbesian commonwealth is a rock of stability, keeping fast through blight and war and civil unrest. The elected monarch, the commonwealth, the Hobbesian philosophy, is the most reasonable and advantageous of the two, the summative and complete champion over Machiavelli. </p>
